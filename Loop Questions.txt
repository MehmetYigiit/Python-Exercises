#Write a program to accept a number from a user and calculate the sum of all numbers from 1 to a given number

#For example, if the user entered 10 the output should be 55 (1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8+9+10)

##Write a program to count the total number of digits in a number using a while loop.

while number != 0:
    cnt = cnt + 1
    a = number // 10

#Write a program to use the loop to find the factorial of a given number.
#The factorial (symbol: !) means to multiply all whole numbers from the chosen number down to 1.

##Write a program to calculate the sum of series up to n term. For example, if n =5 the series will become 2 + 22 + 222 + 2222 + 22222 = 24690
